# canvas-api
Useful scripts for interacting with Canvas.

The scripts are self documenting. Just type "ruby <scriptname>" and it will explain how to use it.

Note that the scripts is a mixture of english and norwegian. You also have to install a separate canvas-api library as well as having a token to access a Canvas server.
